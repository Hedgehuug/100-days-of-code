### Plans:
I will be using primarily Python
- The first 30 days I will be doing [Python30](https://python30.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/02_range.html#), and will post daily projects.

  **Things I want to touch on:**
  - Django
  - Jupyter
  - Git
  - SQL
  - Hashing
  - API Development

### Completed:

### Day 0: 23/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Forked Repo, wrote down initial plans, gonna begin tomorrow

**Thoughts:** Excited and ready to begin an intensive journey of education


### Day 1: 24/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Did day 1 of Python30, the challenges were about args and kwargs in python, and processing positional and keyword arguments

**Thoughts:** Day 1 was not very hard, it took me an hour to go through the reading material and complete all the questions. I've used args and kwargs before, but I never understood them, even if not overused, it definitely speeds up work in cases.

### Day 2: 25/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Python30, tutorial and exercises were on python's Range function, learned about Range, Yield, Round, Floating point issues.

**Thoughts:** Day 2 took me somewhere between 50-60 minutes, I enjoyed the exercises today, especially the challenge to create a floating point Range function, which presented issues I've dealt with before, but it was presented in an easier to understand problem here, so I began to understand the issues with represeting Floats in binary.

### Day 3: 26/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Today's tutorial and exercises revolved around slices in Python, which I've already worked a lot with before, so I was pretty familiar with their use. I did learn 1-2 cool things while going through the exercises. Also did some reading into Hashing, and did some bug hunting in a private project.

**Thoughts:** Day 3 was fine, I was super tired so I'm very glad it wasn't a hard day, but I still got in my 1 hour, learned some new and practiced some old, it was fine

### Day 4: 27/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Topic was Python Map function, a beautiful way to shrink 90% of the loops I write. this is gonna allow so much more reusability in my code, not having to define the loop within the function.

**Thoughts:** I feel very enlightened today, the whole thing took me 49 minutes, but I learned something that will forever change the way I code with python, and how I think about recursion.

**Link:** [Day 4](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day4)

### Day 5: 29/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about python's Filter function, works almost identical to the Map function, except it cannot take multiple sequence inputs. Filter either returns or doesn't return the passed in value.

**Thoughts:** I was suuuper tired today, the last thing I wanted to do was code, but I picked it up, and thank god it was a semi-easy topic. I still got to learn on a day it was very hard to pick work up.

**Link:** [Day 5](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day5)

### Day 6: 30/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Reduce in Python, a very niche high order function, but with some useful elements. I found the side-effects of learning F-strings and isInstance more useful than Reduce.

**Thoughts:** I'm doing okay, I have learned so much about python through these daily exercises, and pumping out working code greatly increases my confidence.

**Link:** [Day 6](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day6)

### Day 7: 31/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: I finally learned about Lambda functions, which are the single-line anonymous functions of python, I also did all of the previous days' exercises with this new function format, which took very long and was pretty difficult. I also used isInstance() to solve one of the problems

**Thoughts:** Honestly with this it's been 7 days, and it is incredible how much I've learned in a week, with lambda functions now I feel like I have once again elevated my code, just like map.

### Day 8: 01/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: today's topic was comprehensions, which are once again a one-line way of creating sequences from sequences, a very useful somewhat alternative to Map

**Thoughts:** I have used comprehension before, so I didn't have to hurt my brain all over again, but the nested comprehension was rough. Overall I have a huge kit now

**Link:** [Day 8](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day8)

### Day 9: 02/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 was Enumeration, once again a topic I've explored before so it was not new to me, it was pleasent to do some exercises on stuff I just had to practice rather than learn, I enjoyed it

**Thoughts:** I did day 9 throughout 2 days, first just looking through the tutorial to see if there was anything new, then it was really late into the night so I finished exercises 2 days later.

**Link:** [Day 9](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day9)

### Day 10: 05/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 was Error handling, learned Try/except/else/finally, also finally understood what Raise can be used for, along with isNumerical()/

**Thoughts:** Error handling was definitely not easy, I think it was the hardest so far, wrapping my head around why this was made the way it was was hard. especially the Raise. the questions were also really hard, but error handling can definitely far far elevate an application, and substantially speed up development.

**Link:** [Day 10](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day10)

### Day 11: 06/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the basics section of Python30, day 11 moves onto our next batch of lessons on Object-Oriented-Programming(oop). Day 1 of OOP was about first of all, decorators, and second @staticmethod/@classmethods.

**Thoughts:** I did not think OOP was just a big thing in Python, I thought since it was built on the principles of objects, it was made to just fill in data for its objects, but there is a surprising amount of depth to OOP. the use of @classmethods to initiate a type of Object from within a class itself is extremely useful and looks super sexy.

**Link:** [Day 11](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day11)

### Day 12: 07/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of OOP we talked about getters/setters in python, and making it look so so clean with @property

**Thoughts:** Property is definitely a useful decorator, if you spend the time to develop something very extensively thought out @property can make development life 10/10 after that, but it is a lot for my brain to wrap around. It's gonna take a while to grasp the really useful things it can do.

**Link:** [Day 12](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day12)

### Day 13: 08/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 13 was about Dunder methods, built-in methods that give the objects more functionality

**Thoughts:** Property is definitely a useful decorator, if you spend the time to develop something very extensively thought out @property can make development life 10/10 after that, but it is a lot for my brain to wrap around. It's gonna take a while to grasp the really useful things it can do.

**Link:** [Day 13](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day13)

### Day 14: 10/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 14 was about Operator Overloading, which are also dunder methods that let us define attributes to compare objects off of

**Thoughts:** honestly can be a useful tool, defining attributes to use when comparing objects can improve readability and decrease the amount of code we need to write

**Link:** [Day 14](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day14)

### Day 15: 11/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Began Django, learned project creation, Applications within Django

**Thoughts:** So far django is way more independent from python than I expected, it seems really powerful, but a lot to learn

**Link:** Not Applicable

### Day 16: 12/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuted where I left off with Django, learned about models and databases

**Thoughts:** the models section of django feels like classes and objects in json format, I hope I'm just early in so it doesn't make sense yet.

**Link:** Not Applicable

### Day 17: 14/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Else for For/While loops, Else for error handling, when we have for loops with break conditions, Else will trigger if the break doesn't.

**Thoughts:** Else is great, I have no experience with using the break in loops, but it's just great that you can use something powerful like else for a more variety of methods.

### Day 18: 15/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Got back to a massive project of mine from before I started this coding challenge, it is a triangular arbitrage trading bot. I redesigned the values to reflect what is most important about the software. 

**Thoughts:** I feel delightfully more confident now than I did when I began that project and worked on it. I wrote that code way better than I expected, but going back through a single one of my packages, I am fixing almost every single function. This really made something apparent in me tho, I struggled to get back to the tutorials for python30 because I didn't want to improve so I don't have to improve the code again

**Link:** Not applicable

### Day 19: 16/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: I continuted on previous day's progress, worked more on the arbitrage bot, fixed a bunch of mistakes I made yesterday, really just making the whole thing more digestible 

**Thoughts:** I messed up pretty bad yesterday, I wrote a bunch of code I thought was being tested, but I was running the wrong file all along, so I was just checking my old code if it still worked, and the new one did not. And so I fixed that

**Link:** Not applicable

### Day 20: 17/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Once again kept going with the trading bot, fixed more mistakes, did some pretty abstraction

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about the project, it will take a long long time to get working again but with my single-focused goal of just getting arbitrage results for bid-ask, and testing consistency

**Link:** Not applicable

### Day 21: 18/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Python30 day16: Recursive functions. Recursive functions are ones that call themselves while modifying a value to recreate recursion.

**Thoughts:** There are way better forms of looping in my opinion, this one feels a little situational, but maybe there are things you can do with this that are hard otherwise.

**Link:** [Day 21(Python30 day16)](https://github.com/Hedgehuug/python_30/tree/master/day16)

### Day 22: 19/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Python30 Day17, Memoization. This was really hard, sure I understand it, but finding an example where it's actually useful is very difficult, the fibonacci one took a surprising amount of time, I tried finding another one that I could time, but it was really hard.

**Thoughts:** Memoization is definitely useful, I wish I could try it out myself, couldn't. I feel like if we go any more complex than currently and it would be really hard to find repeating patterns.

### Day 25: 23/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: BDO Marketplace API

**Thoughts:** Memoization is definitely useful, I wish I could try it out myself, couldn't. I feel like if we go any more complex than currently and it would be really hard to find repeating patterns.
