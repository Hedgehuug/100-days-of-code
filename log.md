# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Plans:
I will be using primarily Python
- The first 30 days I will be doing [Python30](https://python30.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/02_range.html#), and will post daily projects.

  **Things I want to touch on:**
  - Django
  - Jupyter
  - Git
  - SQL
  - Hashing
  - API Development

### Completed:

### Day 0: 23/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Forked Repo, wrote down initial plans, gonna begin tomorrow

**Thoughts:** Excited and ready to begin an intensive journey of education


### Day 1: 24/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Did day 1 of Python30, the challenges were about args and kwargs in python, and processing positional and keyword arguments

**Thoughts:** Day 1 was not very hard, it took me an hour to go through the reading material and complete all the questions. I've used args and kwargs before, but I never understood them, even if not overused, it definitely speeds up work in cases.

### Day 2: 25/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Python30, tutorial and exercises were on python's Range function, learned about Range, Yield, Round, Floating point issues.

**Thoughts:** Day 2 took me somewhere between 50-60 minutes, I enjoyed the exercises today, especially the challenge to create a floating point Range function, which presented issues I've dealt with before, but it was presented in an easier to understand problem here, so I began to understand the issues with represeting Floats in binary.
