# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Plans:
I will be using primarily Python
- The first 30 days I will be doing [Python30](https://python30.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/02_range.html#), and will post daily projects.

  **Things I want to touch on:**
  - Django
  - Jupyter
  - Git
  - SQL
  - Hashing
  - API Development

### Completed:

### Day 0: 23/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Forked Repo, wrote down initial plans, gonna begin tomorrow

**Thoughts:** Excited and ready to begin an intensive journey of education


### Day 1: 24/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Did day 1 of Python30, the challenges were about args and kwargs in python, and processing positional and keyword arguments

**Thoughts:** Day 1 was not very hard, it took me an hour to go through the reading material and complete all the questions. I've used args and kwargs before, but I never understood them, even if not overused, it definitely speeds up work in cases.

### Day 2: 25/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of Python30, tutorial and exercises were on python's Range function, learned about Range, Yield, Round, Floating point issues.

**Thoughts:** Day 2 took me somewhere between 50-60 minutes, I enjoyed the exercises today, especially the challenge to create a floating point Range function, which presented issues I've dealt with before, but it was presented in an easier to understand problem here, so I began to understand the issues with represeting Floats in binary.

### Day 3: 26/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Today's tutorial and exercises revolved around slices in Python, which I've already worked a lot with before, so I was pretty familiar with their use. I did learn 1-2 cool things while going through the exercises. Also did some reading into Hashing, and did some bug hunting in a private project.

**Thoughts:** Day 3 was fine, I was super tired so I'm very glad it wasn't a hard day, but I still got in my 1 hour, learned some new and practiced some old, it was fine

### Day 4: 27/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Topic was Python Map function, a beautiful way to shrink 90% of the loops I write. this is gonna allow so much more reusability in my code, not having to define the loop within the function.

**Thoughts:** I feel very enlightened today, the whole thing took me 49 minutes, but I learned something that will forever change the way I code with python, and how I think about recursion.

### Day 5: 29/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about python's Filter function, works almost identical to the Map function, except it cannot take multiple sequence inputs. Filter either returns or doesn't return the passed in value.

**Thoughts:** I was suuuper tired today, the last thing I wanted to do was code, but I picked it up, and thank god it was a semi-easy topic. I still got to learn on a day it was very hard to pick work up.

### Day 6: 30/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about Reduce in Python, a very niche high order function, but with some useful elements. I found the side-effects of learning F-strings and isInstance more useful than Reduce.

**Thoughts:** I'm doing okay, I have learned so much about python through these daily exercises, and pumping out working code greatly increases my confidence.

### Day 7: 31/03/2021

**Today's Progress**: I finally learned about Lambda functions, which are the single-line anonymous functions of python, I also did all of the previous days' exercises with this new function format, which took very long and was pretty difficult. I also used isInstance() to solve one of the problems

**Thoughts:** Honestly with this it's been 7 days, and it is incredible how much I've learned in a week, with lambda functions now I feel like I have once again elevated my code, just like map.

### Day 8: 01/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: today's topic was comprehensions, which are once again a one-line way of creating sequences from sequences, a very useful somewhat alternative to Map

**Thoughts:** I have used comprehension before, so I didn't have to hurt my brain all over again, but the nested comprehension was rough. Overall I have a huge kit now

### Day 9: 02/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 9 was Enumeration, once again a topic I've explored before so it was not new to me, it was pleasent to do some exercises on stuff I just had to practice rather than learn, I enjoyed it

**Thoughts:** I did day 9 throughout 2 days, first just looking through the tutorial to see if there was anything new, then it was really late into the night so I finished exercises 2 days later.

### Day 10: 05/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 10 was Error handling, learned Try/except/else/finally, also finally understood what Raise can be used for, along with isNumerical()/

**Thoughts:** Error handling was definitely not easy, I think it was the hardest so far, wrapping my head around why this was made the way it was was hard. especially the Raise. the questions were also really hard, but error handling can definitely far far elevate an application, and substantially speed up development.

### Day 11: 06/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: After finishing the basics section of Python30, day 11 moves onto our next batch of lessons on Object-Oriented-Programming(oop). Day 1 of OOP was about first of all, decorators, and second @staticmethod/@classmethods.

**Thoughts:** I did not think OOP was just a big thing in Python, I thought since it was built on the principles of objects, it was made to just fill in data for its objects, but there is a surprising amount of depth to OOP. the use of @classmethods to initiate a type of Object from within a class itself is extremely useful and looks super sexy.

### Day 12: 07/04/2021

**Today's Progress**: Day 2 of OOP we talked about getters/setters in python, and making it look so so clean with @property

**Thoughts:** Property is definitely a useful decorator, if you spend the time to develop something very extensively thought out @property can make development life 10/10 after that, but it is a lot for my brain to wrap around. It's gonna take a while to grasp the really useful things it can do.
